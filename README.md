# Clicks for Fics Process Documentation

### Overview

This project documents the process behind the **Clicks for Fics** project, which analyzes and visualizes the most popular fan fiction works and fandoms on the **Archive of Our Own** platform. The documentation provides insights into the development process, tools used, and methodologies applied to create the visualizations and analyses.

### Template

This project was built using the [Gatsby Starter Glass](https://github.com/yinkakun/gatsby-starter-glass) template, which provides a minimal and beautiful design with a glassmorphism UI. The template was customized to fit the specific needs and goals of the **Clicks for Fics** project.

### Project Structure

The project consists of several main files and directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `gatsby-config.js`: Gatsby configuration file that sets up plugins and site metadata.
- `gatsby-node.js`: Custom Node.js scripts that extend Gatsbyâ€™s build process.
- `package.json`: Contains information about the project, scripts, and dependencies.
- `src`: Source directory containing the main codebase.
  - `pages`: Contains the pages of the project.
  - `templates`: Templates for dynamically generated pages.
  - `components`: Reusable components used throughout the site.
  - `styles` or `css`: CSS files for styling the site.
- `static`: Contains static assets like images used in the project.
- `content`: Contains markdown files with content for the site.
