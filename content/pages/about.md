# Clicks for Fics

On the Archive of Our Own platform, 6.9 million users share their enthusiasm for fan fiction, culminating in a collection of 12.9 million works. These works expand fictional realms including the Marvel, Harry Potter and Boku no Hero universes by introducing new stories, characters and relationships.  

This project analyses the most popular works and fandoms, providing an understanding of the themes and characters that resonate most with the fans on the platform. The results are presented on a website using interactive data visualisations designed to showcase the diversity and creativity of fan fiction. 

**Check out the work and process that came into this project.**
