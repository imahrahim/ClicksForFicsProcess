In the vast expanses of the digital universe, fascinating landscapes shaped by vibrant communities and passionate emotions exist. One of these terrains is the world of fandoms. From books to movies to video games, fandoms provide a rich environment where people can celebrate their love and dedication. However, this fascination goes far beyond mere entertainment. It finds expression in Archive of Our Own (AO3), a platform that serves not only as a repository for fan creations but also as a reflection of the deeper needs and fantasies of many people. Here, fans can bring their creative outpourings to life in their favorite fandomsâ€”whether in romantic fantasies, alternate universes, alternative endings, or by adding missing elements to the original work. Through reading and writing on AO3, they can express their longings and desires and find a place for exchange and boundless creativity. With over 12 million works from more than 64,000 fandoms, AO3 has created a world where more than 6.926 million people currently find themselves sharing their fantasies and creative creations.

On Archive of Our Own, users express their appreciation for works they like through so-called "Kudos." These Kudos can be compared to "Likes" and serve as a strong indicator of which works are particularly well-received. In my following project, I therefore set myself the task of addressing the question of which works receive particularly high recognition in the largest fandoms on AO3 and, above all, why.

- What themes fascinate fans the most?
- Are there specific genres or tropes that are particularly common in the most popular works on AO3?
- Are there specific characters and relationships that are crucial to the enormous recognition of certain works?
- How does the presence of specific ships (relationships between characters) influence the popularity of fan works in a fandom?
- How do the popularity and recognition of works differ across various fandoms on AO3?

My journey into the world of fanfiction began with One Direction on Wattpad, and since then, I've enjoyed reading fanfictions. Over time, I transitioned to AO3. AO3 represents something very personal and intimate, where users often prefer not to disclose what they are reading. This aspect of privacy and the rich variety of creative expression on AO3 inspired me to develop these questions and delve deeper into this topic.


This topic is of great personal interest to me because fanfiction has been a significant part of my life for many years. Exploring the dynamics of fandoms and the reasons behind the popularity of certain works on AO3 not only satisfies my curiosity but also contributes to the understanding of digital communities. By analyzing these patterns, we can gain insights into the collective imagination and desires of a diverse and vibrant online community.
