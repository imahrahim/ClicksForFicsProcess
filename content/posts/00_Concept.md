In the vast expanses of the digital universe, fascinating landscapes shaped by vibrant communities and passionate emotions exist. One of these terrains is the world of fandoms. From books to movies to video games, fandoms provide a rich environment where people can celebrate their love and dedication. However, this fascination goes far beyond mere entertainment. It finds expression in Archive of Our Own (AO3), a platform that serves not only as a repository for fan creations but also as a reflection of the deeper needs and fantasies of many people. Here, fans can bring their creative outpourings to life in their favorite fandomsâ€”whether in romantic fantasies, alternate universes, alternative endings, or by adding missing elements to the original work. Through reading and writing on AO3, they can express their longings and desires and find a place for exchange and boundless creativity. With over 12 million works from more than 64,000 fandoms, AO3 has created a world where more than 6.926 million people currently find themselves sharing their fantasies and creative creations.

On Archive of Our Own, users express their appreciation for works they like through so-called "Kudos". These Kudos can be compared to "Likes" and serve as a strong indicator of which works are particularly well-received. In my following project, I therefore set myself the task of addressing the question of which works receive particularly high recognition in the largest fandoms on AO3 and, above all, why.

What themes fascinate fans the most?

Are there specific genres or tropes that are particularly common in the most popular works on AO3?

Are there specific characters and relationships that are crucial to the enormous recognition of certain works?

How does the presence of specific ships (relationships between characters) influence the popularity of fan works in a fandom?

How do the popularity and recognition of works differ across various fandoms on AO3?

### Project Idea
My work is aimed at the community of these fandoms and the AO3 platform. Therefore, it makes sense that my project will be published online on a website, and I will also publish my process for everyone to see on a website. This way, everyone has the opportunity to follow my process and the data.

Based on the top 1000 works with the most Kudos on AO3, three fandoms are particularly prominent: Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling, Marvel Universe, and Pu nohi-ro-akademia | Boku no Hero Academia | My Hero Academia. In addition to the three most represented fandoms, fandoms such as Teen Wolf (TV), Real Person Fiction (Video Blogger RTF, bangtansonyeondan | Bangtan Boys | BTS) are also more frequently represented.

In the first step, I will focus on the three fandoms that are most represented in the most popular works and analyze the top 1000 works from each of these three fandoms. Depending on the effort and meaningfulness, I will also include the other occurring fandoms, so that especially with Real Person Fiction (RPF), another very large part of the fan fictions would be covered.

On my website, I want to apply the principle of "Overview first, zoom and pan, then details on demand" and in the first overview level treat the top 1000 works. The second level of the website will be a page for each of the three fandoms, where you can take a closer look at the fandom and its individual structure. Finally, I want to provide the opportunity to examine individual elements in detail and provide information on how present these tags, characters, fandoms are also in the other fandoms. This way, you can see a comparison between the fandoms on a smaller level.
