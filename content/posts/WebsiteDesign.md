Since my work so far has been extremely dry and monotonous, and not very visually stimulating, I was all the more motivated to dive into the inspiration and visual concept. Given that the target audience of my work is the community itself, I wanted to establish a visual connection as well. However, I didn't want to design something unique for each fandom, but rather find a consensus for the entire community. Since many fanfictions are also seen on Tumblr and, in general, almost everything is found online on the web, I decided to draw inspiration from 90s/Y2K websites and blog posts. I aimed to incorporate this in the form of color, text, and layout of the website.

Therefore, I first delved deeply into understanding the website aesthetics I wanted to achieve and what already exists on the World Wide Web. Sites like [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Neocities](https://neocities.org/browse), and (one of my favorites:) [lingscars](https://www.lingscars.com/) were a significant source of inspiration.

I quickly noticed that a common denominator of these websites was that they usually had a background image with the website content displayed in divs in the foreground. I found this approach to be a good solution for incorporating multiple layers into my website and using the background as a form of data visualization.

Both the color palettes and the font choices were inspired by the Y2K aesthetic.

For the color palettes, I took some images as inspiration that were in the context of this era or such websites, and also pre-defined color palettes on [coolors](https://coolors.co/).
