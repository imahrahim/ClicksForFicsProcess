Alongside cleaning and organizing the data, I also created some quick standard visualizations using Tableau, Excel, and ChatGPT. This helped me quickly understand what I was working with and identify interesting approaches for my project.

First, I visually analyzed my data again to determine if the points I wanted to focus on were indeed interesting.

I found that there are indeed differences between fandoms, characters, and relationships in terms of tags and ratings. This reinforced my initial decision to focus on these points.

Next, I attempted to visualize one of my relationship datasets with the help of ChatGPT to get a sense of the network and the scale of the relationships. It was challenging to gauge the scope from just the rows in an Excel sheet.

I quickly realized that a force-directed network was not the best choice for making the data easily understandable, as one of the key points for me was to represent the frequency of characters and relationships.
