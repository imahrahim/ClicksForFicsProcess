### Combining my components
With all my components from the website interface, network visualization, and additional tags ready, I could finally start combining them into a cohesive code structure and give the whole project its final form.

### Colors and Data Dimensions

I struggled for a long time to find a color scheme that was both readable and visually appealing. Since I had five colors for the ratings in the background and needed at least four colors for each of my datasets, finding a schema that worked for everything was a continuous challenge.

Through many discussions with different people, it became clearer what was needed and which information was somewhat redundant and hindered readability.

Therefore, I decided to assign a specific color to each fandom and visually distinguish gender. Additionally, I used a single color for links between individual characters, as the node distinctions allowed viewers to identify the relationship categories (m/m, f/m, and f/f) on their own.

### Legends and Text Data
After integrating all these layers, I added textual information to explain what exactly was happening on the website and incorporated a form of legend and scale into my visualization. For the character scale, the x-axis along which characters are distributed by frequency, I decided to use a subtle shaded scale since I was already drawing enough lines in the visualization.

For the legend, I chose not to display it constantly but to make it accessible as a popup window. This way, users could refer back to it as needed without cluttering the interface.
