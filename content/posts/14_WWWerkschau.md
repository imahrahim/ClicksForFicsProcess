### WWWerkschau

The WWWerkschau provides the perfect opportunity to present my project to the public and share the work of the past few months. This exhibition allows me to showcase not only the final visualizations and results but also the entire process from data preparation to the finished website.

I am looking forward to receiving reactions and feedback from the visitors and hope that my work resonates and inspires.
