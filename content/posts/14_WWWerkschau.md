The WWWerkschau is the perfect opportunity to present my project to the public and share the work I have been doing over the past few months. 

Unfortunately, I neglected this aspect for a long time because I did not have a clear idea of what my final product would look like. In addition, it was challenging to decide what context to use and show in my exhibition when everything was happening online on my screen.

My initial idea was to create a poster that would invite people to test my website and give a rough idea of what it's about.

It wasn't until near the end, when I was exporting my work, that I thought about using the entire canvas of my network visualisation for the exhibition. This approach would give a tangible representation of my work and allow several people to view it at the same time, not just on one screen.

So I came up with the idea of hanging my 'banner' in the room so that it could be viewed from both sides. One side would show romantic relationships and the other side would show friendship relationships from the same network.

To achieve this, I modified my code to export the visualisation as a vector graphic and mirrored the text in my nodes on one of the visualisations. This way the whole image can be mirrored correctly.

(How it will eventually be integrated into my exhibition is still undecided).
