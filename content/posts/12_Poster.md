As part of the preparation for the WWWerkschau, designing an exhibition poster was a crucial step. The poster serves as a visual summary of my project and aims to attract and inform visitors at a glance.

First, I brainstormed the key elements that needed to be included on the poster:
- Project title and subtitle
- Brief project description
- Key visualizations and data insights
- Contact information and social media links

Next, I explored different design concepts and layouts, drawing inspiration from my project's visual style and the overall theme of the WWWerkschau. I wanted the poster to be both visually appealing and informative.

I then created a series of drafts using tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, iterating on the design based on feedback and my own observations. The final poster design effectively communicates the essence of my project and invites visitors to explore further.

The process of designing the poster also helped me distill the most important aspects of my project and present them in a concise and engaging manner. This was a valuable exercise in visual communication and design.
