### New Interface
After a while, it became clear that the interface was not very user-friendly and required some adjustments to make the site more understandable. Therefore, I revisited the conceptual design of the wireframes and reprogrammed the website, with the initial goal of simplifying navigation and page transitions.

Next, I integrated my previously programmed network and additional tags logic into the website.

The entire process was one troubleshooting session after another. I could spend an entire day fixing one error, only to have another part of the website break as a result.

I religiously saved everything on GitHub, allowing me to revert to an older version whenever something stopped working.

Without ChatGPT, I could never have achieved this so quickly, and I am grateful that I subscribed to the Premium version for data cleaning at the project's start.

Once most of the elements were in place, I focused on adjusting visual layers and developing a color scheme to visually differentiate the data dimensions.
