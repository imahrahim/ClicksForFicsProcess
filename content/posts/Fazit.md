Many aspects of my process were lengthy and seemed never-ending, with most of the time dedicated to data management and coding. These are elements that people viewing my work won't see or feel. In a way, this is somewhat frustrating. However, I am still immensely grateful that I had to find so many solutions and take detours to reach my goal. These detours taught me a lot about handling future problems and discovering new approaches that will hopefully save me from making similar detours next time.

I have learned a great deal in both coding and data analysis. I became more proficient in Excel, p5.js, d3.js, HTML, CSS, and React. I also made first acquaintance with NLP. In terms of visualization and UX, my mistakes provided valuable learning experiences.

For the first time, I ventured into network data visualization, which was a new and valuable adventure. I learned the importance of identifying relevant data dimensions and how arrangement and color schemes are crucial for supporting a specific message.

With my additional tags, I made a significant detour only to end up with a bar chart. However, this journey was essential for me to experience because I don't think I would have arrived at the current solution without it.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Data and Coding**:
    - The extensive time spent on data cleaning and coding underscored the importance of these foundational elements. Even though these aspects are not immediately visible in the final product, they are crucial for creating a functional and accurate visualization.

2. **Problem-Solving and Flexibility**:
    - The numerous challenges and detours I encountered forced me to develop my problem-solving skills and remain flexible in my approach. These experiences have equipped me with a toolkit of strategies for tackling similar issues in future projects.

3. **Tool Proficiency**:
    - Through this project, I have significantly improved my proficiency with various tools and technologies, including Excel, p5.js, d3.js, HTML, CSS, React, and NLP. These skills will be invaluable for future data visualization and analysis projects.

4. **Importance of Design and UX**:
    - My exploration into network visualization and UX design taught me the importance of thoughtful design and user experience. The arrangement and color scheme of visual elements are critical for conveying the intended message and enhancing user understanding.

5. **Iterative Process**:
    - The iterative nature of my project, especially with the additional tags, highlighted the importance of trial and error. Each iteration brought new insights and led to more refined solutions.

6. **Realizing the Value of Detours**:
    - Although the mistakes were time-consuming, they were also informative. Each misstep and correction provided deeper insights into the data and the most effective ways to visualize it.

### Final Thoughts

Reflecting on this project, I am proud of the progress I made and the knowledge I gained. Despite the frustrations and setbacks, the journey was incredibly educational. I now feel more prepared to handle complex data visualization projects and more confident in my ability to find creative solutions to challenging problems.

I hope that my work provides a meaningful contribution to the AO3 community and inspires others to explore the fascinating world of data visualization.
