### Visualizing Categories

Besides categorizing the tags, I also focused on the visual aspect of the tags. I quickly realized that there would be more than five categories to differentiate, leaving me with only two viable options: text or image.

With my initial sketches, I approached the task cautiously and considered using only frequently occurring tags to reduce the scope further. However, I quickly decided against a text-based visualization as it might resemble the network visualization too closely.

Thus, I explored images and icons that could represent my categorized tags. The initial inspiration came from pixel art and collages found on 90s and Y2K websites. Y2K symbols, in general, were also an early inspiration.

I experimented with various symbols and meanings, but it was challenging to do this parallel to categorizing the tags as nothing was finalized. From classic Y2K symbols that didn't necessarily align with the categories to Greek mythology and Tarot card meanings, I tried different approaches.

In addition to researching meanings for categories, I tested various methods, from Google images and Illustrator drawings to 3D objects and AI-generated images. Over time, I realized I needed to view the images together and in quantity to determine which ones made the most sense.

### Combining my tags

Therefore, I wrote a short p5.js script to draw the images based on data.

I noticed that some order was needed to get a better sense of the frequency of tags. Even though my goal was never to make it perfectly readable, I still wanted to convey a certain mood, indicating differences.

Within this code, I continually adjusted and changed my images, realizing what worked and what didnâ€™t. Eventually, I found a distribution of various images that conveyed the mood I was aiming for and matched my categories.

### Ratings

Besides the tags, I believe the distribution of ratings across different fandoms is an indicator of what fans enjoy reading. Therefore, I considered representing the ratings as a color gradient in the background. Again, it was not crucial for it to be precisely readable; the goal was to give a general sense, for example, that Harry Potter has significantly more Explicit and Mature content than Boku No Hero.

The color scale for ratings had to be continually adjusted to match my node color scheme and the overall website to ensure the readability of the entire site remained intact.
