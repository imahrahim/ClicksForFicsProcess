Categories that are too general, like genre, emotions, or tropes, are not very informative. How many categories are acceptable? Many tags are very specific. What can I group together, and what should I separate?</p>\n<p>So many questions and no definitive answers.</p>\n<p>I considered several categorizations, starting over and changing them repeatedly. It took a long time to find something that fit.</p>\n<p>From using Tarot cards as categories to extremely generic and superficial categorizations, I never got far.</p>\n<p>I consulted AI and discussed what made sense over an extended period. I tried using NLPs to automate the task entirely, but nothing worked or felt right.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to break down the tags and analyze the frequency of words within the tags, hoping this would provide more insights.</p>\n<p>If I thought manually entering 800 characters was a lot, I had another thing coming. One dataset alone had 7000 additional tags.</p>\n<p>So, I had to take a step back and think about what made sense. I decided to reduce my dataset, which I also had to partially fill out manually. I chose to only include tags that appeared at least twice.</p>\n<p>Many tags were fandom- or character-specific, making categorization even harder. How do I categorize something like “BAMF! Peter Parker”? So, I decided to remove all fandom-specific tags, whether they mentioned a character or were unique to that fandom, from the categorization process.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this also had to be done mostly manually. I did my best to search for and filter out all characters and terms in the dataset that could be part of a fandom. This approach proved effective, allowing me to handle multiple rows at once more quickly. With a more streamlined dataset containing only additional tags without fandom-specific content, I applied the same principle and searched for words that were meaningful and could occur frequently enough for categorization.</p>\n<p>Just like with the characters, I started with the overall tags and compared them with the remaining datasets, so I had less categorization work with each subsequent dataset.</p>\n<p>With a more manageable dataset, I could again enlist the help of ChatGPT to categorize the remaining tags. One could debate for hours how meaningful these categorized data are, but I believe that even if it can’t be 100% accurate, it still provides a good overall picture of the fandom’s mood.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/f45e2/wallpapperr10.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75.31645569620254%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Rocket launch\"\n        title=\"Rocket launch\"\n        src=\"/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/f058b/wallpapperr10.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/c26ae/wallpapperr10.png 158w,\n/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/6bdcf/wallpapperr10.png 315w,\n/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/f058b/wallpapperr10.png 630w,\n/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/40601/wallpapperr10.png 945w,\n/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/78612/wallpapperr10.png 1260w,\n/static/7441451fcf982b116c11ef01901e6c88/f45e2/wallpapperr10.png 2628w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Additional Pain","tags":["Data","Excel","ChatGPT","Google","Mental Breakdown"],"date":"May 04, 2024","description":null,"social_image":{"absolutePath":"/Users/imah/gatsby-starter-glass/static/media/wallpapperr10.png"}}},"prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Template"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/Template/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/Tags/","prevSlug":null,"nextSlug":"/blog/Template/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2714594843","3159585216"]}
